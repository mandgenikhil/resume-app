                <p className="p-2">Problems? I like them. Difficult Problems? I like them even more. I was a child who always liked solving tough problems.Making better solutions and try to explore the depth of the each possible way to solve any problem.

                    I worked as a Software developer in Tavisca Pvt. Ltd. for almost 2.5 years. At Tavisca, while working on Core Technologies, I was exposed to myriad opportunities of problem solving and applying logic to implement complex business scenarios. Understanding client’s business requirements, developing solution algorithms and implementing them in real time made my work a joyful learning experience. Different awards like ‘Kudos and star performer, 2017’ added a cherry on top of the cake.

                    Currently, I am working as a Full Stack Software Engineer at Fractal Analytics. In the future, I see myself leading a research group which works on various challenges in the fields like, Software Engineering, Algorithms, Big Data Analysis and Data Mining. My dream is to establish a highly equipped Applied Algorithms lab in my country which will not only provide enough exposure to young students for the research, but also serve as a great way of giving back to the society.

                    I'm always looking for a new problem to solve, so if you’ve got a dozy you need hand with, feel free to contact me directly at
